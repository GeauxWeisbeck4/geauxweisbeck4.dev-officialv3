# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev | Digital Garden and Personal Website of Andrew Weisbeck

Welcome to my digital garden. I have needed to create an official digital garden for quite some time now as I have never really published my workspace that I consider my digital garden for one reason or another. I think part of the reason is that I have multiple machines with a bunch of different note collections and resources using different tools. This project aims to consolidate all those different collections into on space so I can share my knowledge with you and work in public. 

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Framework to help you build kickass websites and apps. Astro is my absolute favorite for a lot of different reasons, but mainly due to its developer friendliness and speed. It is really easy to create content sites with Astro.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Another piece of this stack that you will see in almost every other project of mine. Just makes it so much easier to build something with TailwindCSS than to write out all the custom CSS, which I can do, I just love Tailwind too much now though.
- [React.js](https://react.dev) - React is used to create some of the components in the initial development of the website, but I am not sure if they will stay or not yet. Stay tuned for more info.
