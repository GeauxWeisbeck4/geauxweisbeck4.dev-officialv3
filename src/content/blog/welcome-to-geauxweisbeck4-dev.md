Welcome to [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev), the digital garden/front porch of Andrew Weisbeck. I am still learning more about the front porch and need to decide if that is what this site should be regarded as - I think it is likely that is what it should be but not quite sure yet.

What I do know that this is my own little corner of the internet where I get to create and write about whatever I want. It will probably revolve heavily around coding as I want this to be kind of like my developer journal where I can share what I am learning and creating for others to see.

Here are some of the cool features I've added so far and also other features I plan on adding in the future.

## Agile Kanban Board

This is a definitely a trial feature that I want to experiment with. I already have enough Kanban tracking going on with [Asana](https://asana.com) and [Linear](https://linear.app) - well, lately I've been using [Plane](https://plane.so/) which is an open source version of Linear, which I think is also open source but maybe I'm wrong, but it is very similar.

I haven't decided if I want to use my Kanban board that I created, which feels pretty cool. I think I would add my own API too which would be cool. But I could also use Jira or Asana's API to list my tasks as well.

If you like it, let me know. If not, also let me know.

## Notes Section & Pages

The notes section will hopefully fill out with some more notes. These won't be notes from my Obsidian app that I use. They will be more thought out and well written notes - the ones I write in Obsidian are often copy and pasted, written quickly, and not as well thought out. They are more information collecting where I want these notes to be thought provoking, helping me and others learn, and a way to connect ideas to create better ideas.

## YouTube Videos

I'm putting this here for a big reason other than your entertainment - I need accountability to keep creating content. If people expect my videos to be made, I will have to do it. I'm going to try to make at least one a week

## Upcoming Features

- **Spotify Playlist:** I have the component created, but I haven't figured out how to keep it playing when you change pages. Look for this to be figured out soon.

- **Guest Book/Comments:** I want you to leave direct feedback or be able to say hi. This is coming soon.

- **Bento Grid Homepage:** The home page is pretty basic right now because I have a lot to create already. I want to make a cool Bento style grid page that would be unique and cool.

## Conclusion

Take a look around and get a feel for what you see. I'd love any feedback or comments that you may have to share with me. I hope to get a survey up here sometime in the near future.
